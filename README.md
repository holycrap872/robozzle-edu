# Robozzle-edu

This project is an attempt to clean up the client-side JavaScript code for
[robozzle](http://www.robozzle.com/beta/index.html?puzzle=-1). I use it in
my Middle School and High School classes extensively and I want to make sure
that it is able to be around for many years to come.

Currently the project is focused on updating the JavaScript to TypeScript and
adding all the latest niceties (e.g., tests, linting, and docs). After that
will come an effort to encode certain "key" levels that I use a lot in my class
so that the client doesn't have to rely on the server being up. Finally, we will
focus on integrating the new client with the existing server code and perhaps
even updating the server.

This project is proceeding with the blessing (and support) of the original
Robozzle creator: Igor.
